# 🌐 Static Website Hosting on AWS S3

This is my first AWS cloud project. I used **Amazon S3** to host a simple static website with just two HTML files.

---

## 📁 Files
- `index.html` – Homepage
- `error.html` – Error page

## 🚀 What I Did
1. Created an S3 bucket with public access.
2. Uploaded website files to the bucket.
3. Enabled static website hosting.
4. Configured bucket policy for public read access.
5. Accessed my live website using the provided S3 URL.
